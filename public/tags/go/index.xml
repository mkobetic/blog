      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this topic in the back of my mind for a while and recent talk by Russ Cox brought it back to the foreground. As with any of Russ&amp;rsquo; writing it is well worth your while, I highly recommend you check it out. Of course he makes most of the points I wanted to make and then some, so my remarks will be mostly just a reaction to his talk.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this topic in the back of my mind for a while and recent talk by Russ Cox brought it back to the foreground.

Of course he makes most of the points I wanted to make and then some, so my remarks will be mostly just a reaction to his talk.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of plaintext accounting (PTA) ever since I stumbled upon it about a decade ago. I was using gnucash back then for some time. While it&amp;rsquo;s a solid and well documented tool, the GUI paradigm just wasn&amp;rsquo;t working well for me. I distinctly remember that cumbersome manual input into the transaction &amp;ldquo;spreadsheet&amp;rdquo;. In comparison, the flexible plain text input with PTA felt like a breath of fresh air.</description>
